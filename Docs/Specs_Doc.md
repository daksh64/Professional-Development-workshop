## Requirement Analysis:
Education is the most powerful weapon you can use to change the world and the 
 next is the Internet. The era of coronavirus broke the long-time practice of  conventional education in only classrooms and we got introduced to e-Learning  platforms. Today we have many e-learning platforms like moodle, one of Chandigarh  University’s own LMS, etc. The education industry is evolving and what it needs  is an efficient e-learning platform to provide distance education as well as  maintain the interest of students and keep them motivated and at the same time  maintain quality of education. It should be flexible and must offer a wide  variety of courses on a single platform without having to get into the hassle of  traveling and is hence cost-effective. 

 
### What are we going to do?
- Create a web application for online and distance learning.
- Develop an onboarding process for new users (both instructors and students) to familiarize them with the platform's features and functionalities.
- Provide training materials or resources to help users make the most of the platform.
- Provide content in the form of PPTs, videos, audio, lecture notes, or other documents.
- Inclusion of gamification elements, such as badges, leaderboards, etc. to enhance user engagement and motivation.
- Establish a data backup and recovery strategy to prevent data loss and ensure business continuity.
- Include feedback mechanisms within the platform for users to report issues, suggest improvements, or seek assistance.

## Scenarios:
•	Ria is a college student who is pursuing BBA but wants to learn about psychology so she goes on to an e-learning platform and enrols herself into this course. She sets weekly reminders to complete her course, and keeps track of the work done by the progress bar. She’ll have to complete assignments and quizzes to complete her course. She is motivated to achieve her goals by the certificate she’ll achieve in the end as it will add a bonus to her resume as well.

•	While completing her course Ria forgot about an assignment which was due that night. She had a lot of college work which made her forget about her deadline. But thankfully she got a reminder that her due date had arrived and she completed her assignment on time.

•	When Ria was going through the lecture notes she was confused about a topic. She tried to google it but still could not understand. Then she discovered the doubt clearing section. She uploaded her doubt and Mukesh (her instructor) cleared it.

•	Mukesh is a 30-year-old educator who is a seasoned industry expert in psychology. He wants to add a secondary income to his old boring school job. He thinks he is much more capable than just teaching 12th grade students, so he goes onto an e-learning platform and uploads his videos, presentations, notes and assignments. His first student is Ria so he assesses her assignments and grades.
